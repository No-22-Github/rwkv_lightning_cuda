# HTTP API examples

[English](http-api.md) | [简体中文](http-api.zh-CN.md) | [Back to README](../README.md)

This page covers the native inference service. For Launcher Client/Agent control, authentication and backend forwarding, see the [integration guide (Chinese)](../RWKV_Lightning_CUDA_Launcher/docs/integration-guide.md).

The complete endpoint reference (in Chinese) lives in
[rwkv_lightning_api_doc.md](../rwkv_lightning_api_doc.md). The examples below
assume the server is running on port `8000`.
If the server was started with `--password`, pass either a Bearer token header or the `password` field in JSON:

```bash
AUTH_HEADER=() # No server password
# With a server password, replace the line above with:
# AUTH_HEADER=(-H "Authorization: Bearer your-password")
```

Run the examples in Bash after setting `AUTH_HEADER` in the same terminal.
Run the serial endpoint smoke test from the repository root:

```bash
./test/api_endpoints_test.sh

# Custom host, port, or password:
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 PASSWORD=rwkv7_7.2b ./test/api_endpoints_test.sh
```

## Service status

Check whether the backend is running, which model is loaded, supported capabilities, active request, and paused requests.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/server/status"
```

## Model list

OpenAI-compatible model list endpoint.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models"
```

## Token count

Count tokens for raw text.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/tokens/count" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"text":"hello RWKV"}'
```

Count tokens for chat messages after applying the backend chat prompt template.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/tokens/count" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

## Initial state files: upload, list, and delete

Upload a serialized RWKV state first, then pass the returned filename as `state_id`
to a chat request. Uploaded files are validated as PyTorch state archives and
kept in a process-local temporary directory. They are removed explicitly with
the delete endpoint or automatically when the server exits. The upload limit
is 512 MiB. State tensors stored as either PyTorch `bfloat16` or `float32` are
supported; they are converted to the configured WKV runtime precision while
loading.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/state/upload" \
  -F "file=@./rwkv-state-agentic.pth"
```

The response uses the uploaded file's basename as its ID, for example
`{"object":"rwkv.state","state_id":"rwkv-state-agentic.pth"}`. Uploading a
file with a name that is already present returns an `already exists` error. Use
that value in a generation request:

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model":"api-test",
    "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Continue from the supplied state."}],
    "state_id":"rwkv-state-agentic.pth",
    "stream":false,
    "max_tokens":8
  }'
```

Omit `state_id` to use the normal zero-initialized state. All inference
endpoints accept the same string field: `/v1/chat/completions`,
`/v1/batch/completions`, `/translate/v1/batch-translate`, and
`/state/chat/completions`. Every endpoint above also accepts `state_id`
through an `X-RWKV-State-Id` request header instead of the JSON body; conflicting
values across channels return HTTP 400, while repeating the same value is
accepted (`/v1/state/delete` additionally accepts `?state_id=...` in the query
string under the same rule). For a batch
request, the uploaded state is copied
to every batch slot before its prompt is evaluated. On the stateful endpoint,
an explicit uploaded state takes precedence over the cached `session_id`
state for that request, and the resulting state is cached back into the
session afterward. Chat requests carrying `state_id` default to the classic
`User`/`Assistant` prompt without a think prefix, matching typical state-tuning
data. An explicit `think_type` overrides this behavior; `think_type:"none"`
also disables the prefix explicitly.

### List and delete uploaded states

Listing also accepts `POST`; deletion also accepts `POST`. A successful deletion
returns HTTP 200 with `state_id` and `deleted:true`; a missing state returns
HTTP 404 with `deleted:false`. Missing or conflicting IDs return HTTP 400.
Listing returns `object:"list"` and a `data` array containing `state_id`,
`filename`, `size_bytes`, `tensor_count`, and `created` (Unix seconds).
These files are separate from the session cache managed by `/state/status`
and `/state/delete`.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/state/list"

curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/state/delete" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"state_id":"rwkv-state-agentic.pth"}'
```

When `--password` is enabled, use an `Authorization: Bearer ...` header for the
multipart upload request.

## MiSS adapter lifecycle and request fields

Register a server-side PTH path or upload a local PTH using multipart form data.
Both `adapter-final.pth` and new checkpoint `training.pth` files are supported.
Legacy two-file inference directories also work. Registration returns
`{"adapter_id":"task-a","version":"<content SHA-256>"}`. Registration
validates and caches the package in CPU RAM; it does not upload weights to GPU.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/adapters" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"adapter_id":"task-a","path":"/absolute/path/miss_output/checkpoint-100/training.pth"}'

curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/adapters" \
  -F 'adapter_id=task-a' -F 'file=@miss_output/adapter-final.pth'

curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/adapters"
```

All generation endpoints accept `adapter_id`, optional `adapter_version`, and
optional `adapter_scale`. The first request uploads the complete adapter to the
GPU; prefill and decode reuse it without per-layer or per-token transfers.

New PTH files carry their manifest inside the archive. Old training checkpoints
need the sibling `checkpoint.json`; for remote upload add
`-F 'metadata=@miss_output/checkpoint-100/checkpoint.json'` alongside the PTH.
Upload staging files are removed after registration; only D in its declared BF16/FP16 precision remains cached; BF16 D is converted once in pinned staging on GPU admission.
Use bearer-header authentication for multipart uploads when password protection
is enabled. HTTP request-body limits also apply to uploaded checkpoint files.

```json
{
  "adapter_id": "task-a",
  "adapter_version": "sha256-content-version",
  "adapter_scale": 1.0
}
```

Omit `adapter_version` to bind the latest registered version at request
admission. `adapter_scale` is the absolute effective scale override. Stateful
sessions are isolated by base-model lifetime, adapter content version, scale,
initial state, and WKV precision, so an incompatible cached state is rejected.
Deletion removes the registration while existing request handles remain valid.
It does not remove files on disk. Omit `adapter_version` to delete every version
of the ID, or include it to delete only that version. The response is
`{"deleted":true}`, including when the ID or version does not exist. Deleting
the latest version falls back to the most recently registered remaining version:

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/adapters" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"adapter_id":"task-a"}'
```

The `data` array contains `id`, `version`, and `manifest` for each registered
version. Top-level metrics are `ram_hits`, `gpu_hits`, `gpu_misses`, `uploads`,
`h2d_ms`, `ram_bytes`, `gpu_bytes`, and `gpu_peak_bytes`.
The list response includes RAM/GPU hits, misses, uploads, H2D time, resident
bytes, and adapter GPU peak bytes. Package format and cache-budget details are
in the [MiSS guide](../src/miss/README.md).

## Chat completions

OpenAI-style chat endpoint. Use `stream:false` for one JSON response.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model":"api-test",
    "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hello in one short sentence."}],
    "think_type":"fast",
    "stream":false,
    "max_tokens":8,
    "temperature":1.0,
    "top_k":5,
    "top_p":0.3,
    "alpha_presence":0.2,
    "alpha_frequency":0.2,
    "alpha_decay":0.99,
    "stop_tokens":[0,261,24281],
    "chunk_size":1
  }'
```

`think_type` controls the assistant think prefix for chat-message prompts:
`none`, `fast`, `free`, `preferChinese`, `en`, `enShort`/`en_short`, and
`enLong`/`en_long`. `fast` uses a short closed think prefix and does not force
reasoning. The other modes force reasoning by masking tokens `111` and `754`
on the second and third generated tokens. If `think_type` is omitted,
`enable_think:true` or `think:true` maps to `free`; otherwise the default is
`fast`.

Use `stream:true` for SSE chunks. The stream ends with `data: [DONE]`.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -N -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model":"api-test",
    "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hello in one short sentence."}],
    "think_type":"fast",
    "stream":true,
    "max_tokens":8,
    "temperature":1.0,
    "top_k":5,
    "top_p":0.3,
    "alpha_presence":0.2,
    "alpha_frequency":0.2,
    "alpha_decay":0.99,
    "stop_tokens":[0,261,24281],
    "chunk_size":1
  }'
```

## Batch completions

Generate independent continuations for multiple prompts. Each streamed chunk uses `choices[].index` to identify the slot.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/batch/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "contents":["English: Hello\n\nChinese:","English: Good morning\n\nChinese:"],
    "state_id":"rwkv-state-agentic.pth",
    "stream":false,
    "max_tokens":8,
    "temperature":1.0,
    "top_k":5,
    "top_p":0.3,
    "alpha_presence":0.2,
    "alpha_frequency":0.2,
    "alpha_decay":0.99,
    "stop_tokens":[0,261,24281],
    "chunk_size":1
  }'
```

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -N -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/batch/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "contents":["English: Hello\n\nChinese:","English: Good morning\n\nChinese:"],
    "state_id":"rwkv-state-agentic.pth",
    "stream":true,
    "max_tokens":8,
    "temperature":1.0,
    "top_k":5,
    "top_p":0.3,
    "alpha_presence":0.2,
    "alpha_frequency":0.2,
    "alpha_decay":0.99,
    "stop_tokens":[0,261,24281],
    "chunk_size":1
  }'
```

## Batch translation

Compatibility endpoint for batch translation-style prompts.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/translate/v1/batch-translate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "source_lang":"English",
    "target_lang":"Chinese",
    "text_list":["Hello","Good morning"],
    "state_id":"rwkv-state-agentic.pth"
  }'
```

## Stateful completions

Use `session_id` to reuse and update a saved RWKV state. This endpoint accepts exactly one prompt in `contents`. `session_id` may also be passed through an `X-RWKV-Session-Id` request header (also honored by `/state/delete`); conflicting values between the body and the header return HTTP 400, while repeating the same value is accepted.

```bash

curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/state/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{
    \"session_id\":\"api-test\",
    \"contents\":[\"User: remember the word albatross.\\nAssistant: <think>\\n</think>\\n\"],
    \"stream\":false,
    \"max_tokens\":8,
    \"temperature\":1.0,
    \"top_k\":5,
    \"top_p\":0.3,
    \"alpha_presence\":0.2,
    \"alpha_frequency\":0.2,
    \"alpha_decay\":0.99,
    \"stop_tokens\":[0,261,24281],
    \"chunk_size\":1
  }"
```

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -N -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/state/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{
    \"session_id\":\"api-test\",
    \"contents\":[\"User: continue.\\nAssistant: <think>\\n</think>\\n\"],
    \"stream\":true,
    \"max_tokens\":8,
    \"temperature\":1.0,
    \"top_k\":5,
    \"top_p\":0.3,
    \"alpha_presence\":0.2,
    \"alpha_frequency\":0.2,
    \"alpha_decay\":0.99,
    \"stop_tokens\":[0,261,24281],
    \"chunk_size\":1
  }"
```

List cached sessions:

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/state/status" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{}'
```

Delete a cached session:

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/state/delete" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{\"session_id\":\"api-test\"}"
```

## Stop, pause, and resume

Stop the active generation. If no request is active, the response still returns `ok:true` with `stopped:false`.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/server/stop" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{}'
```

Pause the active generation and save the current state. The response contains `request_id` when a request was paused.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/server/pause" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{}'
```

Resume a paused generation by `request_id`. The response is an SSE stream.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -N -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/server/resume" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "request_id":"req-xxxxxxxx",
    "stream":true
  }'
```

## CORS preflight

The server accepts `OPTIONS` on API routes for browser clients. Depending on the HTTP framework path, a successful preflight may return `200` or `204`.

```bash
curl -sS "${AUTH_HEADER[@]}" -i -X OPTIONS "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions"
```
